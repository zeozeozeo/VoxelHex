# VoxelHex(v0x7H3X)
![Repository logo](https://github.com/Ministry-of-Voxel-Affairs/VoxelHex/blob/61cc0cc36becdc93a63ab7b7ca3dc3b65a3e54cd/new_logo.png)
A Sparse voxel-brick tree implementation in Rust/WGPU.
The leaf nodes of the tree contain voxel bricks instead of a single Voxel. This makes it possible to have a unique compression system, where Voxels of different resolutions can be mixed together.
An implementation for raytracing is available with GPU support!
The library uses Left handed Y up coordinate system.

Roadmap:
- Shadows, Lighting, Illumination: https://github.com/Ministry-of-Voxel-Affairs/VoxelHex/milestone/2
- Data Compression, Load time minimizations: https://github.com/Ministry-of-Voxel-Affairs/VoxelHex/milestone/3
- Displaying Vast Voxel landscapes: https://github.com/Ministry-of-Voxel-Affairs/VoxelHex/milestone/1
